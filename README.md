# TMDb Movies Dataset Analysis
This is the second of three projects required to graduate the [Professional Data Analysis Nanodegree program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002-mena-nfp2/syllabus/core-curriculum).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The aim of the project is to go through the typical data analysis process, from wrangling, EDA, to posing questions suited to the datset and answering them. The findings are communicated clearly at the end, and the flow of analysis is documented throughout the whole proces.

### Methods Used
* Desctiptive Statistics
* Data Analysis
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Description

The dataset used is taken from Kaggle and contains information about ten thousand movies from the 60's to 2015.
We are exploring the most and least popular genres/ directors/ actors and actresses/ movies throughout the years, as well as what factors seem to be correlated to success in terms of popualrity (higher budget, genres, production companies.. etc.)
Different charts are drawn to help get a sense of the numbers.
However, since the datasets seems to be random (doesn't have specific consistent standards for the movies it includes), all findings are only tentative and does not give final answers to the questions being explored.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Here's the link to the original Data in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). 
2. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/hoda0/TMDb-movie-data-Udacity-Project/blob/main/tmdb-movies2.ipynb)
